== Book A Room
While working at the State Library of Queensland I repeatedly ran into trouble scheduling a private study room. This process should be easy and sexy, so I decided to write a rails app that could make that happen. 

Because I am using my time in said study rooms to bone up my Rails skills, and the skill most needed is BDD, I will be using RSpec and Cucumber extensively.
